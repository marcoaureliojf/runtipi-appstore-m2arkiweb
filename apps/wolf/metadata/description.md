Wolf is a streaming server for [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/) that allows you to share a single server with
multiple remote clients in order to play videogames!

![Wolf basic flow chart](https://github.com/games-on-whales/wolf/blob/stable/docs/modules/ROOT/images/wolf-introduction.svg?raw=true)

It's made from the ground up with the following primary goals:

- Allow multiple users to stream different content by sharing a single remote host hardware
- On demand creation of virtual desktops with full support for any resolution/FPS without the need for a monitor or a
  dummy plug.
- Allow multiple GPUs to be used simultaneously for different jobs
    - Example: stream encoding on iGPU whilst gaming on GPU
- Provide low latency video and audio stream with full support for gamepads
- Linux and Docker first: run your games with low privileges in containers (based
  on [Games On Whales](https://github.com/games-on-whales/gow))
- Mostly hackable, just edit the config file to modify encoding pipelines, GPU settings or Docker/Podman low level

It's a specific tool for a specific need, are you looking for a general purpose streaming solution?
